##Part 2
>We would write a program that would always print the fizz-buzz values for 1 to 17.
This could be done by hard coding max as 17 in the main method. The main method would always output the save values.

##Part 3 
>We could have built a tester class with the gradle format which passes in an argument. Or called an assert statement which would return true or false for an expected response and a hard coded value. The response could be returned in the terminal based on passing or failing the test.

##Part 4
>The logic that decides whether a number or fizz buzz appear or are stored in the array stays the same throughout the exercise.
It does not really matter from a functional standpoint which type you choose, it is more stylistic.

>One way an array list does give us some freedom is related to the length of arrays. When instantiating an array the length must be set.
The more dynamic arrayList with its add method function allows us to be more flexible with the growth of the array.
